					<h2>Real World Examples</h2>
					<p>
						Obviously, cultural evolution, of the kind I'm writing about, is just about everywhere you look. That said, there are some specific examples I find interesting.
					</p>
					<h3>Architecture</h3>
					<p>
						Architecture was the first domain in which I thought to apply this model. The idea came from Age of Empires, where the various cultures are visually identified by their architecture, mostly (with some forced standardization like the Mongols' walled cities). I envisioned a kind of 4X or City-building game where each culture could have its own living architecture, reflecting different their diplomatic and trade relations as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						Architecture is especially interesting because it is very lasting (at least when built in stone). We can get a longer glimpse into the past and see how it changes in time (in the western tradition, with Greek and Roman architecture being similar, then to Romanesque and Gothic, then Renaissance going back to earlier models, Baroque taking ornamental detail to the extreme, and so on), but we also see differences very clearly in space (consider Japanese, Chinese and Korean architecture) and sometimes the various influences (For example the Khmer and modern Cambodian case of Indic and Chinese influence, or how Hindu architecture and Islamic architecture were hybridized in India).
						The examples are everywhere, and are almost often beautiful to see!
					</p>
					<p>
						Another aspect that favours architecture is that it is composed of fairly discrete elements with continuous variations - you can look at columns, roofs and stories at the highest level, then descend to capital, shaft and column (for columns), and so on. This makes it more controllable (one culture can borrow, say, columns wholesale, and vary the roof slope only slightly) though still a big undertaking, of course.
					</p>
					<h3>Miniature Painting</h3>
					<p>
						This is a kind of painting seen mostly in books, often featuring patterned textures and weird perspective. Just as interesting is the cultural relations - perhaps taken from China to Persia by the Mongols, where it developed in different ways. it further specialized by the Ottomans (Turkey) and Mughal (India) examples.
						There are also "western" miniature paintings, mostly for illumination of holy books, but I am not sure whether they have a common origin.		
					</p>
					<p>
						What I love about it is that it is that it is not only a very clear example of art being tied to political relations, but it is also a fairly specificialized form that nonetheless finds its own local flavor wherever it flourished.

					<h3>Epic poetry</h3>
					<p>
						Epic poetry is one of my favourite examples, but also one of the most elusive - especially when you consider the oral epics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most people are familiar with Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, because they were written down and started a whole new tradition - that of the literate epic. This kept going with the Hellenistic Argonautica, the Roman Aeneid, and the later countless "national" epics (like the Lusiads, La Franciade, and the Chilean Araucaniad and many many others). The Indian epics Mahabharata and Ramayana play that role in India and South-East Asia.
					</p>
					<p>
						That said, epic poetry was often oral and, to some extent, improvised, as described in the wonderful book "Singer of Tales". It was also extremely wide-spread. The germans and norse had this tradition (culminating perhaps in the Norse Poetic Edda and the German Nibelungenlied), and so did the irish (seen in the written version "Táin Bó Cúailnge" and other cycles). It's also very active still in Turkey and Central Asia.
						The main problem is that they are often sung in small villages and don't get written and translated for the benefit of the internet!
					</p>
					<p>
						The structure of this is ripe for cultural influence, though, be it in the themes (which battle are fought, against whom), the customs they portray, or the music they accompany. There are always many versions of the "same" story circulating, and the story may never be told in exactly the same way twice - but this is exactly what one wants when simulating culture. Constant tweaking and reevaluation (sometimes aesthetic, sometimes political, or whatever else).
						It is, granted, perhaps a bit harder to program at the moment - or maybe poetry is simply not my area (also true)!
					</p>
					<h3>Shadowplay</h3>
					<p>
						This one is more recent, and about shadow puppet theater. Specifically, the Indian and South-East Asian varieties. I became interesting in Gamelan music, and found out it is extremely common across South-East Asia (From India to Thailand and all across Indonesia).
						Like miniature painting, it is another example of a specialized art form that nonetheless is full of local flavor! You can see, for example, how the puppets themselves look very different in Java and Bali, which are extremely close together in space - the reason being perhaps Islam, which was against human representation in art; the puppets from Java, where Islam took hold, are a lot more stylized, whereas in Bali the puppets have more human-like.

					</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						It is also a compound art form, with the puppet design, the music and the stories themselves being free to vary across places. Javanese and Balinese Gamelan are different, but still very much about metallophones; the Indian tradition seems more focused on vocals and the percussion, while still important, is very different. 
						Finally, most of the themes and stories come from the Indian oral epics (Mahabharata and Ramayana), but these are also reshaped in whichever culture they take hold.
