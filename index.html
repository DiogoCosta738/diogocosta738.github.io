							The Magic Flute is the official companion game to the 2022 movie of the same name. <br>
							It is a rhythm game designed to be played with a real recorder through the microphone input.<br> 
							I was the main programmer working on the game, and also extended the design from the previous apps to provide a more polished and complex experience - I believe players can and should be challenged, when provided with tools that make learning smoother and empower the player.<br>
							I also brought new techniques in animation and VFX to the table, resulting in a more polished look and feel.

							Anarchima (placeholder name) is a tactical cRPG I've been developing in my spare time in 2022.<br>
							Its biggest influences are Ultima and the early Fallouts, with a heavy focus on narrative design, where quests set up conflicts between various towns with multiple solutions. The different solutions change internal variables that will determine the decision available in the end-game as well as their outcome in a game that goes beyond good/bad.<br>
							The combat, although not as much of a focus, is being designed to provide a much wider toolbox to the player, allowing for both tactical depth (with positioning, flanking, tile attacks, etc.) as well as study and preparation for fights (with buffs and versatile equipment).<br>
						</p>
						<p><ul>
							<li> Focus on choice, consequence and intention</li>
							<li> Tactical combat (positioning, flanking, tile effects, buffs, elemental weaknesses)</li>
							<li> Modding tools (branching dialogue with checks and rolls, tile editor, item/enemy editors, etc.)</li>
						</ul></p>

							AmalgamA is a casual puzzle game where levels are generated using a cellular automaton.<br>
							Everything came together beautifully in about a month and a half of work (although the ideas, unknowingly to me, required a brewing period during which I was learning about and playing around with cellular automata).<br> 
							The cellular automaton provides puzzles that quite literally grow from a small seed, resulting in very aesthetically pleasing results (if I may say so myself!).<br>
							The music, although not at all relaxing, was also procedurally generated, with dissonance tied to the puzzle state (it starts out very dissonance, but slowly becomes consonant and uplifting as you solve the puzzle).<br>
							Despite its very apparent flaws, I am still very happy with it, especially in its symbolism and how each element reinforces each other. It was very organic to develop, with each element being the way it is almost out of necessity.

						<p><ul>

							Angkhorror is a prototype of a horror "walking-sim", inspired by Ultima Underworld, the works of KittyHorrorShow and Indian/Khmer Architecture.<br>
							It unfortunately did not come together in the end, but I am happy with various of its elements, which I may still use in the future.<br>
							I tried to capture the fractal nature of Indian architecture with custom 3D modelling tools.<br>
							The combined use of the low-fi aesthetic also let me using various kinds of textural noise (using shaders) to design the abstract ornaments for friezes and other panels.<br>
							I was very happy with the skybox, using a previous high-res starsky shader, coupled with dithering and larger stars to work in a low-res setting.<br>
							Unfortunately, compression kind of killed the video, so please check the project page for crisper screenshots.

						<p>
							This project was my first application of a shader.<br>
							I had learned about much more expensive cellular automata after working on AmalgamA, but those were too slow to explore with my old tools.<br>
							So I took an MSc course on graphics, learned the basics of shaders, and implemented this one. It's quite beautiful!<br>
							The most important different is that cells look at every neighbour within a radius of 20 or more cells, instead of radius of 1. A shader's parallelization really makes it work in real time, enabling exploration, which is key to finding the coolest patterns!<br>
							They grow really organically, it's really great to watch. I colored them with a simple gradient (based on time of stabilization), but then perturbed the saturation and luminosity of the colors for a better result.

							Having used shaders for a bit, at this point, I was very familiar with the applications of "fractal brownian noise" and the like for basic terrain generation, but something was missing.<br>
							Then, I saw Loren Schmidt's own work (unfortunately lost to time), which excited me with the possibility of simulating erosion.<br>
							This, then, was the result. I first implemented a shader-version (in shadertoy), based on a heightmap, but then found a paper to simulate erosion in meshes and decided to try it out.<br>
							It combines erosion (from rain) with a constant, if slow, uplift due to tectonic movement.<br>
							I love the results, has a great textural quality, and is quite fast, too (runs in linear time).

							The previous slides include my favourite projects. This one is reserved for the remainder.<br>
							Voronoi Tilings, as the name suggests, is a tool that uses voronoi diagrams to create floor tilings.<br>
							Celtic Knots is a tool to create simple stylized celtic knots using the "cut method" and Bezier Curves for finer-grained stylization.<br>
							Apollonian Gaskets is a tool to generate colorful ornaments using the fractal apollonian gaskets (circles all the way down).<br>
							The shader experiments were especially important to learn how to use various kinds of noise to synthesize textures and created VFX. I have also experimented a bit with multi-pass effects like outlines and sun shafts.
